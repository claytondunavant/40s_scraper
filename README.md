### Introduction

 Welcome to my first somewhat legit Github project.  
 
 The gist of the project is that I'm a sucker for 40s big band and swing and the best source of said music that I've found was Siruis XM's 40s Junction.  The issue is Siruis XM is a paid subscription-based service and why pay a service I could replicate myself.  

### How it works
Sirius XM has a website that shows the current song being played for each channel.  In this case I was interested in the [40s Juction channel webpage](https://www.siriusxm.com/40sJunction).
